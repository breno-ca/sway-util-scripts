Creates a window switcher for SwayWM using fuzzel in dmenu mode.

Motivation: SwayWM does not have a built-in window switcher.
This script lists open windows, grouping them by workspace or,
and allows selecting a window to focus on. The script also supports
custom icons and workspace renaming for a better user experience.

Example usage in Sway configuration:

	bindsym Alt+Tab exec ~/scripts/window_switcher.sh

Requirements:
- jq: to parse swaymsg output
- fuzzel: to create the window switcher

Note: The script was designed with fuzzel in mind but can be 
adjusted to work with rofi by modifying the dmenu item output.
